# Application Overview

* The idea here is that a user is going to search for a movie on the left hand side of the screen and a different one on the right hand side of the screen so user is going to type in some movie title and then once they search for it we're going to fetch some information about that movie and show information about it on the left hand side of the screen.
* There will be shown information about how much money it made and its critic critical rating and so on once a user searches for a movie on the left hand side they're then going to repeat that same process on the right hand side. So we can imagine that a user might type in a different movie over here like "The Avengers" and we will show some information about the Avengers in a very similar fashion on the right hand side. 
* Every different movie will be compared between the two whichever movie has a higher statistic. We're going to highlight in green in whichever movie has the lower statistic. We're going to show in yellow. So in this case the Avengers made a lot more money at the box office than the dark knight. So we would color that statistic as green and we would color the Dark Knight statistic as yellow. However the Dark Knight might have a higher critic rating. So we'll show that is green and the Avengers 1 will be displayed as yellow instead so that's the application. 
* A user might not know exactly what movie they're looking for. They might have some kind of idea of what the title is but they might only be able to remember that like has dark in the title. If they are trying to find dark knight. So these two inputs right here are not going to be normal inputs. Instead we're going to make them into kind of auto complete inputs. So whenever user types in something like just "dark" or even "dark night" we're going to have a little pop up listing right here that shows a couple of different movies related to the search term that they just entered. So to actually select a movie and start the comparison a user would have to click on that entry right there and that would select "The Dark Knight" that was made in the year 2008 on the left hand side of each of these movie titles. We're also going to show the poster for the movie as well. This is going to be a separate little autocomplete widget that we put together as a part of this project.
